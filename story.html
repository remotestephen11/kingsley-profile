          <p>
            Kingsley Chimankpam Nwafor, a proud son of Etche Local Government Area in Rivers State, refused to remain quiet.
            At under forty, polytechnic trained, unpolished by foreign institutions yet tempered by intellect and tenacity,
            he conceived a vision that could transform Nigeria’s crude oil export landscape. That vision became the Green Energy
            International Limited export terminal.
          </p>

          <p>
            It would not have been realised without the discerning ear of Professor Anthony Adegbulugbe, a leader who saw potential
            where others measured youth as limitation, who valued ability over pedigree and who gave opportunity the form it deserved.
          </p>

          <blockquote class="nQuote">

              Kingsley’s career is living proof of the power of relentless pursuit. With over a decade of hands-on experience,
              he has operated in twenty-two of Nigeria’s twenty-eight export terminals, spanning onshore facilities, Floating
              Production Storage and Offloading units and Floating Storage and Offloading vessels.
            </p>

            <p>
              His expertise extends to production planning, programming, crude handling agreements, export coordination,
              and commercial management. A COREN certified engineer and accredited crude oil inspector with the International
              Federation of Inspection Agencies, Kingsley holds a Postgraduate Diploma and Master’s degree in Power Engineering
              from the Rivers State University of Science and Technology.
            </p>

            <p>
              Yet his credentials, impressive though they are, are only the surface. His edge lies in seeing what others overlook,
              imagining what others dismiss, and refusing to let age, circumstance, or convention dictate possibility.

            It was this vision that birthed Nigeria’s first indigenous onshore crude oil terminal, the Otakikpo Crude Oil Terminal,
            a bold statement that Nigerian innovation can rise to global standards unbowed by traditional expectations or foreign validation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Professor Adegbulugbe’s decision to trust Kingsley was more than mentorship. He did not measure potential by age.
            He did not dismiss the value of polytechnic training. He did not seek credentials abroad to validate talent.
            He listened, he believed, and in that belief, a nation witnessed the transformative power of opportunity given
            to the right mind at the right time.

        <div class="nStory">
          <p>
            Over four hundred crude oil export operations later, Kingsley’s journey is proof that Nigerian youth are not a problem to manage.
            They are the solution waiting to be heard. The story challenges leaders across the nation. Talent without opportunity is wasted
            brilliance, and brilliance ignored is a tragedy no country can afford.
          </p>

          <p>
            Sixty-five years of independence offers a moment to reflect. How many Kingsleys have been silenced by hesitation, dismissed by scepticism,
            or sent abroad in search of recognition that should have been given at home. How many visions have died at the first no.
          </p>

          <p>
            Nigeria must listen. Nigeria must trust. Nigeria must act. Age, institution, and foreign pedigree must never eclipse courage,
            creativity, and intellect. Brilliance thrives where opportunity meets resolve. The future of this nation belongs to those who push,
            speak, and refuse to be silenced.
          </p>

          <p>
            Let Kingsley’s story ignite a movement, a recognition that the energy, vision, and audacity of our people are the very forces
            that can elevate Nigeria to greatness. Leadership is not merely holding power. It is creating space for genius to breathe,
            to act, and to transform.
